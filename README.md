## üõ† Setup Instructions

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend (NestJS + MySQL + Socket.IO)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/queenlive-fullstack.git
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd queenlive-fullstack/backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Set up your environment:

Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and add the following:

env
Copy
Edit
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_DATABASE=queenlive
Run the backend:

Start the server in development mode (watch mode with hot reload):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run start:dev
‚öôÔ∏è Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Socket.IO)
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the frontend:

Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Frontend UI:

The frontend is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

The live chat feature uses Socket.IO to send and receive messages in real-time. Orders can also be placed through the frontend, which will trigger real-time notifications.

üí¨ How to Use the Real-Time Chat Feature
Open the app in two different tabs (or different browsers).

Send a message from one tab ‚Äì it will be displayed in real-time in the second tab, demonstrating the live communication feature.

Click on the order button to place an order. The backend will process the order and send a notification to the frontend.
